				<p class="row-p">One of the traits people tend to like about a culture is the food. I am no exception, because the food in Japan is amazing. Most of us think of sushi when we think of Japanese food. However, there are quite a vast amount of options of food in Japan. My favorite being Mochi!</p>

				<p class="row-p">My love for cars started quite late in life. I never had HotWheels toys as a kid. However, after I got my first car I started to learn about all types of cars. Japanese sport cars such as the Subaru WRX STI and the Toyota Supra quickly became my dream cars. Many people state that these cars are the pinnacle of their respective companies and I would have to agree.</p>
